# Go todo + htmx + tailwind + lit

This project is a simple todo app using go, htmx, and lit web components. It's the first time I've ever used any of these technologies
but I gotta say, it was a blast ðŸš€!

### installation

1. install the node dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### running the development environment

If you want to use google OAuth, please set it up on your end; I have not included
my credientals in my repo ðŸ˜Š

To run the development environment, execute the following commands in order:

1. start the docker containers:
   ```shell
   make docker:start
   ```
2. start the server using `Makefile`:
   ```shell
   make dev
   ```
3. view the app at `localhost:8080`
